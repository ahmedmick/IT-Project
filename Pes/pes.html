    <p>"Why do sports games insist on an annual release even if their content is weak? 
        Is it a constitution or a mandatory law or what?
         When they can drop their game release for a year as long as it doesn't offer any root content of its own and come back the next year stronger?
          Real? Is it a rule, for example? And if it was a habit, why did I find players encouraging companies on this principle by buying the same game for $60 sometimes as well? </p>

        <p class="p">
            The biggest improvements that we have noticed so far is the increased response of players to implement the skills and movements required, unlike PES 2020, which was difficult to implement some movements than others, PES 2021 comes easily in response to the implementation of these skills, it can be said that it is absolute compared to last year's version.As for the level of in-game AI, there have been some improvements in automatically selecting the target player after passing the ball.
            In general, the new version of the game can be evaluated by 8/10, especially as it comes with a huge price reduction compared to last year's version, and it takes into account the limited update in the 2021 version.
            Konami announced the new version on September 15, and it is currently available on PC, PlayStation 4 (PS4), and Xbox One.
            The new camera angle added more realism.
    <br> 1-Flexible and improved scrolling system.
    <br> 2-The acoustics in the game are great.
    <br> 3-The graphics are just as amazing as the last part.

        licensing problem
        The eternal problem now for PES after EA has eliminated it is the licensing issue. Almost if you don't buy a copy of the game from a team, you won't get the licensing features, be it costumes, logos, stadium, etc.

        Personally, I like to play with a team called Manchester United not Manchester B so those things are killing me and in the absence of the official logos, trophies, uniforms and licensed stadiums for the main teams that we already play most of, 
        PES 2021 killed the fun of playing except for the characters or licensed players like Neymar, Messi or Van Dijk And others, but without that, the licenses are limited to literally unknown teams on the map and patrols that are not even followed.

        Price, price and price!
