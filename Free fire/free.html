                <p> <span class="i">Garena </span> <span class="k">Free</span> <span class="l"> Fire</span>  (also known as Free Fire) is a battle royale game, developed by 111 Dots Studio[2] and published by Garena for Android and iOS.[3][4] It became the most downloaded mobile game globally in 2019.[5] The game received the award for the "Best Popular Vote Game" by the Google Play Store in 2019.[6] As of May 2020, Free Fire has set a record with over 80 million daily active users globally.[7] As of November 2019, Free Fire has grossed over $1 billion worldwide.[8]

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    The game consists of up to 50 players falling from a parachute on an island in search of weapons and equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose their starting position, take weapons and supplies to extend their battle life.

                    When players join a game, they will enter a plane, which will fly over the island. While the plane is flying over the island, the players can jump where they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the players must then go looking for weapons and utility items

                <p>The graphics were described as having "a benefit for mid and low specification phones", but a reviewer stated that "if games with good graphics are your thing then we don't recommend that you play Free Fire Battlegrounds. But if you like battle royale games and want to have fun with your friends, you should definitely play
